Nifty Agent locator, showing agents you can access and how many jumps out they are, also quick waypoint and information of them.


Big warning tho, as i am a "learn as i go", my code is at best, cluttery, there may be wrong approaches to things, but they do work.
The database structure is missing, will figure something out for you to fill the void.
Will also get the databasedump convertion for the CMS system, ship fittings uses a shrunkdown version of eve databasedump.
